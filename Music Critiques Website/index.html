                <p class="pintro1">During the summer of 2023, I decided to embark on many forms of self-improvement.
                    Forms included reading, starting a new diet, investing, learning more Computer Science languages,
                    and ultimately, broadening my musical knowledge. In doing this, I decided to listen to a new album
                    every gym session (so five times a week), all some of the highest rated albums of all time. These
                    albums have ranged in genres from Rap, Hip-Hop, Rock, Alternative Rock, Blues, and more. Included on
                    this webpage are my personal ratings and thoughts on the albums. If you agree, that's great, and if
                    you don't, then that it the beauty of music. It is subjective and we recieve it differently than
                    others.</p>
                <p>Before you start, read the following points and keep them in mind while reading. Pleasant reading!
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> These albums are greatly compared to each other. So a 8.7 is an 8.7 in comparison to the 9.5's
                        and so on. This is important because a 6/10 album may be 6/10 compared to the other albums
                        components like lyricism, production, and etc, but I may thoroughly enjoy it outside of this
                        ranking. </li>
                    <li> Additionally, ratings and ranking may change since I am continuing learning the backstories of
                        the albums included, and the artists who made them.</li>

                    <p><strong>Initial Thoughts:</strong></p>
                    <p>this album was musical excellency! For rap, it can’t get better, to me, and for music as a whole,
                        still the same lol. For the themes, I resonated with the themes of mental instability and faith,
                        as seen in my song choices of You ain’t gotta lie (mama said) and Alright. But as this album is
                        known for, the theme of the African American heritage and life were stellar, as I saw in I and
                        Mortal Man. This album was my first introduction into deeper meaning albums, and to even do this
                        list and musical journey. This album caused me to have to not only look up what his lyrics
                        meant, but do background research to many of the phrases and music used in this album. It is
                        because of this, though, that I don’t give it a 10/10. If I was more in African American culture
                        and was a deeper rap and Hip Hop lover, then I could. Lastly, Wesley’s Theory is underrated and
                        has a lot of layers for just an opening song. </p>

                    <p><strong>Initial Thoughts:</strong></p>
                    <p>At the time of intial listen, I was not an avid rock fan, and am more of a rap head but I must
                        say…this album was phenomenal! The first note to make is that the instrumentals of this song
                        were outstanding, with the most riveting being solos like on"The Great Gig in the Sky" and
                        "Money". Secondly, the messages about fleeting time and mental instability, seen on Brain Damage
                        and Time, were very evident, but I enjoyed other messages like the attaction but burden of
                        making money with Money. The music on this album flowed from each song almost seamlessly. While
                        many songs were moving, "Us and Them" stood out as one of the more emotional songs on the album,
                        and it did not feel like a 7 minute song either time I listened to it. The only points I deduct
                        are because I have not done the research needed to grab every detail in this album, and the
                        opening was a bit weak for me. </p>

                    <p><strong>Initial Thoughts:</strong></p>
                    <p>This was my final album in my musical summer experience, and it was one the strongest albums I
                        have listened to since the beginning of my journey! This album did so many things right, but to
                        show those, you need to understand the history of this album. This album was a rejuvenating
                        project for Paul Simon, who had been battling depression, divorce, and a lackluster previous
                        album. This album was created during the time of the horrific Apartheid, which meant that it
                        broke boycotts from the U.S. on African connections. This album encompassed U.S. based styles in
                        Pop and Classic Rock, but introduced the styles of Mbaqanga, folk, and Afro pop. Every song has
                        its own style, with some like Homeless and Under African Skies giving the African musicians he
                        teamed up with the opportunities to shine. The lyrics all had messages behind them, like the
                        results of Apartheid (Homeless), foreign influence and impressions (You Can Call Me Al), the
                        misuse of riches (Diamonds On The Sole of Her Shoes), and more. In my mind, this album had flaws
                        only in the progression of the music.</p>

                    <p>this album was fantastic! The messages present in this album of depression, anxiety, faith, and
                        being true to one’s self resonated with me greatly, but the other themes of guilt, street life,
                        and love were also fantastic. My first hot take: Real is EXTREMELY underrated and overhated. But
                        when it came to top songs, I had to say Sing About Me I’m Dying Of Thirst because this song is,
                        in my mind, perfect. The beat switch, message switch, overall conflict in the background between
                        the young men, and the ending with the faithful woman makes this song a 10/10. The other two are
                        just all around great listens and relatable to me as a person. The only points it gets off are
                        just for some unclear messages in songs like Bitch Don’t Kill My Vibe and Poetic Justice.</p>

                    <p>Good god this album was good! I wanted to rank it higher, but some themes I need to do research
                        on since apparently this album is also a self exploration for Lauryn Hill, so rating is subject
                        to change. The messages of sadness and love were very present and lively in songs like Ex
                        factor, Nothing Even Matters, and Forgive Them Father, and all the songs of the album were fluid
                        and most were danceable and upbeat. </p>

                    <p><strong>Initial Thoughts:</strong></p>
                    <p> Starting off with a bang in Wanna be Starting Something, this album is a continual train of pop
                        excellency! The songs Thriller and Billy Jean are probably the most well known, but unlike hit
                        songs on other albums, they didn’t outshine and put down the other songs. The lyrics of the
                        songs were simple and repetitive (somewhat of a con for me), with the album discussing love and
                        desire, excluding the amazing and somewhat comedic story of Billy Jean. The feature from Paul
                        McCartney was unexpected and he blended with Michael Jackson great, and I love their
                        conversation at the end of the song (The Girl is Mine). Lastly, THE king of pop, Michael
                        Jackson, was stellar. His vocals and enthusiasm in this album are not able to be done by another
                        artists with this same track list. My only flaws of this album were the ending song, which just
                        seemed out of place, with the music leaning into a darker tone, which contrasted every song on
                        this album. </p>

                    <p> This album was nothing short of incredible. First, the opening of this song did its job by
                        giving an entrance into the vibe and atmosphere to expect while listening to this album.
                        Furthermore, this album wasn’t just music and singing, but it was a live show, so you could feel
                        and hear the excitement of the audience as they listened. Second, James Brown. James Brown’s
                        voice was spectacular and made every song much more powerful. The songs themselves were simple
                        love songs, but with the R&B instrumentals and Brown’s voice, they sounded profound. Lost
                        someone is a love song that I feel needs to be praised for a standout love song. I Don’t Mind
                        was a song that could be interpreted multiple ways, where I found myself thinking it told the
                        somewhat narcisistic thoughts of a person who thinks they are the”prize” in the relationship.
                        James Brown made this show memorable. </p>

                    <p><strong>Initial Thoughts:</strong></p>
                    <p> This album is one of the most well regarded rock albums, and I am now in love with it. From the
                        beginning, the album starts off with one of the most memorable songs, Come Together, and doesn’t
                        lose steam. This album’s instrumentals were different than other rock albums, with some songs
                        including non-traditional instruments like tambourines and ,maybe, a xylophone, but still
                        staying true to the traditional rock instruments of electric guitar and drums. The music itself
                        was amazing, with rock styles being obvious but others like Latin (Sun King) and country
                        (beginnings of Something and Octopus’s garden) were great to see. The storytelling of this album
                        was not truly serious, which was actually appealing because no background or true insight is
                        needed to understand it. The notable storytelling to me were Octopus’s Garden and Maxwell’s
                        Silver Hammer. The only thing that brings this down is the lack of real deep messaging to the
                        album, but honestly, that’s it. </p>

                    <p>This album was amazing. The vibe of this album never left positivity. The vocals of this song
                        were not of usual rock, with melodic and angelic aura the primary focus instead of rough or
                        loud. The songs were all outstanding, with messages ranging from the classic love, but also
                        going your own way (Dreams). Furthermore the styles of the albums switch because of the
                        inspiration the main writer/band had, but the style changes work, never abandoning that
                        aforementioned atmosphere. I enjoyed how deeper in the album, more majestic and mythical theme
                        underlies the lyrics. This album had incredible highs in Dreams and Chains , but never outshined
                        its other songs. The only deductions are from re~listenability.</p>

                    <p> All I have to say is is that Stevie Wonder did his thing and I have little complaints. This
                        album was such a lovely experience all the way through. Stevie Wonder had big hits, from the
                        legendary Sir Duke and the later Notorious B.I.G. sampled Pastime Paradise, but in my opinion,
                        was outshined by many other songs on this album. For the first time, not one of the albums
                        biggest songs is in my top 3 OR honorable mentions. For storytelling, this album has generics
                        like love, but fresh messages about loving your masculinity in Black Man and the state of the
                        world’s violence in Village Ghetto Land. For instrumentals, I loved the upbeat Jazz and Soul of
                        this album, and the brass of this album was also notable. The biggest complaint I have is with
                        runtime. This album came in at 1 hour and 45 minutes, and while it was great from front to end,
                        that still is a LONG-winded album. </p>

                    <p>This album was a fantastic experience and listen. The album was my first purely country album,
                        and it did things that were so fresh. The instrumentals of classic country were great,
                        especially the inclusion of harmonica. Johnny Cash’s voice was great, and so were his wife’s and
                        few features. The vibe of this album was the “live audience” seen in Live at the Apollo and
                        Stankonia, but had a lot more meaning behind it since the audience were prisoners and the songs
                        were directed towards them. The storytelling was notable, and the comedic conversation
                        inclusions were also great in songs like Flushed from the Bathroom of Your Heart and Cocaine
                        Blues. Lastly, it ended on a great song in Freestone Chapel.</p>

                    <p>This album was such an interesting concept, and it work perfectly. This album had aspects that I
                        have not heard from any album that made it an album I couldn’t get enough of, and also one of
                        the most edgy albums I have listened to. First, the production of this album was insane, with
                        the musical rhythms being all over the place but never becoming annoying or “too much”. Also,
                        the narrative that this album has severe influence from early supervillain comics and media. The
                        atmosphere of this album never broke, with the eerie and dark themes shining. The lyricism on
                        this album also stood out with long, drawn out verses. The voiceover of the album was also
                        something fresh and gave it that early superhero show feel. MF Doom and Madlib were artists that
                        I did not know before, but they definitely made a great first impression with their, again,
                        lyricism, but also their malicious voices that truly gave this album its wicked vibe. </p>

                    <p> This album was a phenomenal listen! This album had so much that worked. Starting with the
                        instrumentals, this album has the typical rock instruments in drums and electric guitar, but
                        incorporated instruments with Jazz and R&B influence like trumpets and saxophones. For the
                        atmosphere, this album had heart in the love lyrics in Astral Weeks, Sweet Thing, and The Way
                        Lovers Do, but also the mystic elements seen similarly in Rumours and Led Zeppelin IV. Lastly,
                        this album was made special by Van Morrison, whose voice was incredible on this album. This
                        album has flaws, like the lack of deeper messaging and some songs aren’t really ones to listen
                        to on a daily basis. </p>

                    <p>This album was a great listen, and an immersive experience in classic rock. This album has a
                        stellar opening in Black Dog, but the storytelling in many of the songs were standout. The
                        analogy of a medieval story in the Battle of Evermore for conflict and the results of war was
                        the most standout storytelling. The Battle of Evermore also has a different score than I could
                        imagine coming from a classic rock album, but in the best way possible. Additionally, Going to
                        California is an underrated but compelling love song. Stairway to Heaven is a Led Zeppelin
                        classic, but unlike other albums, it does not overshadow the other songs on the album. The
                        styles used in this album are the last thing to note, because 3/4 songs listed above all have
                        different musical choices, but they all work very well together. This is a rock classic, and it
                        deserves nothing less</p>

                    <p> This album was quite an experience, but in a great way! This album came before Madvillainy, so I
                        can see where maybe Madvillainy took inspiration, because many of the themes I loved in
                        Madvillainy are present in this album. The music is edgy, but surprisingly the lyrics never get
                        as edgy as the music. Songs like Method Man and the dialogue interludes do talk about heavy
                        violence, but with an 1 hour and 17 minute run, it’s negotiable. The dialogue between the
                        members of the Wu Tang Clan were great and gave insight into the song we were about to listen
                        to. Lastly, the ending dialogue of CREAM was such a tone switch but needed to discuss the ending
                        deep message of being careful in todays society. </p>

                    <p> This album was fantastic! This album did a lot of things right. It stayed true to the classic
                        rock instrumentals but still was able to have different musical styles, like the pop influence
                        in U Pretty Thing and angelic simple rock in Changes. This album had subliminal messages in
                        simple lyrics like escaping this world in Aliens on Mars? and giving love a chance with the
                        seemingly undeserving in Kooks. David Bowie’s voice was stellar, with the album allowing his
                        range to show, ESPECIALLY on Song for Bob Dylan, where Bowie was able to wonderfully replicate
                        the cadence and instrumental style of Bob Dylan. </p>

                    <p>This album was one of the biggest change in styles that I have seen from a Rock album. While most
                        rock albums have slight deviations but still hold the traditional instrumentals, which is not a
                        bad thing at all, this album almost ditched standard electric instrumentals for more non
                        traditional instruments like standard guitar, tambourines, and harmonicas. For storytelling,
                        this album was with those that have simple storytelling, with memorable ones being Stuck in
                        Mobile with the Memphis Blues, Leopard Skin Pill Box Hat, and Fourth Time Around. The cherry on
                        top of this album was Bob Dylan’s voice. Bob Dylan’s voice is a higher pitched voice with slight
                        raspiness, but it worked flawlessly with the albums instrumentals and country-like feel. </p>

                    <p>This was ANOTHER great listen from Bob Dylan. This album did have its differences from Blonde on
                        Blonde and Highway 61 Revisited, with this album having a more blues influence. This album did
                        not abandon the non-standard instrumentals that has been very intriguing from Bob Dylan, and his
                        voice and cadence are still the exact same. This album has storytelling of random characters and
                        their story relevant to the song as the other albums have, but I feel that if I had to show
                        someone a song that captured Bob Dylan, I would show Lily, Rosemary, and the Jack of Hearts.
                        This song had intricate storytelling with fantastic “Bob Dylan” classic instruments. </p>

                    <p><strong>Initial Thoughts:</strong></p>
                    <p> This album was another great go around with Bob Dylan. The instrumentals on this album seemed a
                        bit more electric than Blond on Blond but it still kept its Blues and Country inspired
                        instruments. The storytelling from Bob Dylan was once again great, with notable ones were the
                        events that transpired and ended at Highway 61 and wild lives of people throughout history on
                        Desolation Row. This album also had an emphasis on details. He found himself describing scenes,
                        people, or emotions with much vividness. His voice and overall style is still the same, and that
                        is nowhere near a bad thing. This album had great highs and I don’t think any real notable lows.
                        The opening and close to this album were stellar, with both being in my top 3. </p>

                    <p>This album was a standout hard rock album! This album was classified as hard rock, but when
                        compared to the presences of Metallica and Gunz N’ Roses, this album was not as hard, which I
                        enjoyed but some may not. This album had the hard rock instrumentals, with notability going to
                        the bridge Eruption, When it came to lyrics, this album had generic messages like love, but with
                        Jamie’s Cryin’, explored toxicity of love. The song You Really Got Me is iconic, but did not
                        outshine this album. </p>

                    <p>this album did a lot of things right! For starters, the vocalists of TLC were fantastic, with
                        this being my first all female group, and second female led album (first one being from The
                        Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill). This album had a very similar scheme to Lauryn Hills’s album, but
                        offered differences that allowed it to be something of its own. It was a direct but melodic and
                        lovely album about feminism and loving one’s self. But even with women at the core of the target
                        audience, I still resonated with messages of leaving fake friends (Case of a Fake Freiburg) and
                        valuing the woman you have (CrazySexyCool interlude). Speaking of, the album was able to have
                        blunt lyrics but still blend it with CrazySexyCool Interlude. Some lyricisms and songs that were
                        very direct to women were some flaws or things that effected its overall relistenability. </p>

                    <p>This album was another great listen from David Bowie, while I don’t like this album as much Hunky
                        Dory, it still offered a lot on my listen through. similar to Hunky Dory, this album used the
                        science fiction and make believe based storytelling, but for musical styles, took on more Pop
                        and Electronic influences. The messaging of escapism and love were still present, actually more,
                        in this album, and David Bowie’s voice really made this album shine. </p>

                    <p><strong>Initial Thoughts:</strong></p>
                    <p> Even putting away my own biases, since Eminem was the first rapper I ever listened to and is
                        still in my top 3 rappers of all time, this album was quite a compelling experience. When it
                        came to production, most of the songs on this album had strong hooks and music, with the music
                        focusing more on the vocal performance and “adlibs” from Eminem. Additionally, Eminem is without
                        a doubt one of the greatest rappers of all time, and this album showed his infamous style of
                        intricate but yet inappropriate and vile lyricism. The messaging of this album was deep, with
                        messages of harm inflicting stardom (Stan, Who Knew), the psychological thoughts that come with
                        a toxic relationship (Kim), staying true to yourself (The Way I Am), and more. While this album
                        was great, I have to deduct points for the extremity of violence in this album. Same with NWA, I
                        tried to look past the vileness of some songs and lyrics for the sakes of the album, but this
                        album did have some truly rough and thought provoking moments. </p>

                    <p> This album fantastically blended different styles and the classic instruments of rock against
                        angelic vocals and fiery energy. The vocals on this album were fantastic. The instrumentals were
                        fantastic, with standard rock instruments being used, but electric guitars providing different
                        styles to songs like Sweet Child O Mine, It’s So Easy, Mr Brownstone, and others. Like I’ve
                        noted on some albums, the feel of classic rock was present, but the lyrics never quite discussed
                        the stereotypical sex and/or drugs, and leaned more into love (My Michelle) and having a crazy
                        time (Welcome to the Jungle). Speaking of, Welcome to the Jungle is one of their most well known
                        songs, and it made for a perfect opening. </p>

                    <p>this album was another great deviation from standard rock. This album had instrumentals that
                        weren’t anything exceptional, other than the fantastic close and solo that is European Son, but
                        the rest of this album was quite an experience. The vocals from group were somber and angelic
                        but yet not depression inducing. Their lyrics weren’t that simple, with messages ranging from
                        fatal attraction and seduction in Femme Fatale or an intricate telling of drug addiction in Run
                        Run Run. All Tomorrow’s Parties is a song that is perfect showing of the albums somber but yet
                        powerful lyrics and music. My issue with the album was the audio. I don’t know how to explain
                        it, but some voices cut in and out weirdly, and some music seemed to become louder than the
                        voices. It may have been Apple Music, and I hope so, because that is probably my biggest issue.

                    <p>this album was such a great listen. This album was another dive into Metal, but unlike my listen
                        with Metallica’s Master of Puppets, this album did not seem as heavy, with it including
                        commentary on the current political environment. The commentary on War Pigs / Luke’s Wall was
                        the most evident with aspects of politician corruption and the judgement of God in our current
                        acts. The music itself was standard metal instrumentals, but there was a notable standout of
                        drums on this album, seen especially with Rat Salad. The vocals from the great Ozzy Osborne
                        were, well, great. His voice was a factor that made this album not quite feel its Metal nature,
                        which is no complaint from me. On the negative side, Iron Man was not favorite song and some
                        vocal changes on Electric Funeral are my biggest complaints. </p>

                    <p><strong>Initial Thoughts:</strong></p>
                    <p>this album is nothing short of an R&B/Soul classic, and it’s present why. The opening to this
                        album was outstanding with one of the most well known Marvin Gaye songs, What’s going on. This
                        album not only had fantastic soul and blues elements, but the messages presented on the song
                        were, famously, the standout. The messages of faith (God is love) and how people are hurting the
                        world resonated the most with me. This is also what lowers the grade, because while the music
                        itself can be replayed and enjoyed, the lyrics may not be as much. The very political messages
                        make the albums replay ability at different times and mindsets limited. Other than that, this
                        album was nothing short of outstanding.</p>

                    <p> What a great introduction to Queen! It was surprising that this album had the legendary Bohemian
                        Rhapsody in its track list and that still wasn’t my favorite track. This album had vocals that
                        sounded very similar to those of Van Morrison and the Beatles, put together with musical
                        production that was very well done. This album had classics in You’re My Best Friend and
                        Bohemian Rhapsody, but they never shined brighter than the other tracks. This album had many
                        different styles like the rock centered Bohemian Rhapsody, Pop inspired You’re My Best Friend,
                        and the slight country influenced ‘39. All around, a very solid album that included one of
                        rock’s most well-known songs. </p>

                    <p><strong>Initial Thoughts:</strong></p>
                    <p> This was my second full album listen from the Beatles (the first being Abbey Road). This album
                        had such a wider scope than Abbey Road, and the Beatles did a great job. With a 30 song track
                        list, this album had range in almost every aspect. For storytelling, the album had its more
                        basic storytelling, but also those that stood out, like the description of Mother Nature’s Son
                        and the duel and death of Rocky Raccoon. Like Abbey Road, this album had childlike centered
                        music that were more present in songs like Piggies, Blackbird, and Obi La Di Obi La Da. On the
                        other hand, this album had its darker themes, especially death/murder, like in the Continuing
                        Story of Bungalow Bill and Rocky Raccoon. This album had a great opening but even better close,
                        in the riveting Revolution 9 matched with the angelic Good Night. My flaws came from the runtime
                        and that though the range of this album was wide and done well, sometimes the sequence of songs
                        didn’t quite go well. </p>

                    <p>This album was a powerful and great listen from Public Enemy. When it came to instrumentals, this
                        album was standard. The music styles and production were similar to those seen on albums like
                        Stankonia and Straight Outta Compton. The real standout points of this album were the messages
                        and the artists. This album incorporated messages that are still relevant today, like selling
                        out to the ones in power (Caught, Can We Get a Witness), black unity, and supremacy (Terminator
                        X on the Edge of Panic). This album also incorporated powerful samples from Martin Luther King
                        Jr. and Malcolm X. To the artists, this album also allowed artists of Public Enemy, like
                        Terminator X and Flavor Flav to have their time to shine. This album had a style similar to
                        N.W.A.’s but the lyrics were never as violent or sharp. </p>

                    <p> This album, like many, had a story behind its making, and was an all around great album.
                        Focusing on the album solely, this album was unique in that it had very little lyrics, with a
                        paragraph being spread out over the course of a song. The focus was on the funk instrumentals,
                        which incorporated electric guitar, drums, and an electronic piano. The music was great and
                        catchy, but the messages behind these songs is what sticks out the most. Messages like the ones
                        that survive turmoil are the strongest of us (Brave & Strong) and being pressed on time and what
                        to do with the little we have (Time). For the story, this album was suppose to be the response
                        to the glorious What’s Going On? album by Marvin Gaye. While What’s Going On? leaned heavily
                        into Blues, this album leaned into the funk and more instrumental-focused blues. If comparing,
                        this album is not as strong, but was a worthy follow up album concept from Sly and the Family
                        Stone. </p>

                    <p><strong>Initial Thoughts:</strong></p>
                    <p>This album was a great listen. It started off with a great intro in Intro, and actually kept a
                        consistent style throughout the album. The album had rap classics like In Da Club and Many Men
                        (Wish Death), but these tracks did not overshadow the other songs on this album. 50 Cent
                        lyricism really shines through on this album. While he talked about the typical gangster topics,
                        he discussed incidents in his past in Many Men (Wish Death) that he learned lessons from,
                        ranging from fake friends to gang hits, and discusses the struggle for a gangster to live in
                        todays world (Patiently Waiting, Life on the Line). This album had its range of legendary
                        features like Nate Dogg and Eminem, but they didn’t overshadow 50. Surprisingly, this album was
                        not as violent in its discussion of its material compared to other albums on this list, yet
                        still stayed true to its gangster preachings. </p>

                    <p> This album is said to be one of the best hard rock album of all time, and I can see why. This
                        album was an amazing listen from start to listen. The opening (Hells Bells) was a fantastic
                        introduction to what to expect from the rest of the album. The songs were all instrumentally
                        fluid with each other. Now the issues for me. One, the songs were of course good but the four
                        songs that stuck out were Shoot to Thrill, Back in Black, You Shook Me All Night Long, and Hells
                        Bells, which were their biggest songs. These songs kind of stuck out like a sore thumb a bit
                        because of that, overshadowing the others. Second, since this is HARD rock, song aspects like
                        the entirety of the song “Have a drink on me” were a bit too intense for me. Third, but an
                        addition to the last point, this album is one I have to be in a certain mood to listen to. </p>

                    <p>This album was another great listen from the legend Kanye West. Interestingly, all three albums I
                        have listened to by Kanye all have different styles, with this one having more of a focus on the
                        teaching and advice-giving format from Graduation mixed with 2000’s music production. The
                        messages of this album were, given from the title, about the struggles and things we do to
                        achieve our highest self, including going to college. In this album, Kanye got personal on Last
                        Call and told his story from dreamer to international superstar. The messages on the School
                        Spirit skits could resonate with any student because Kanye discussed the roads other than
                        college and how college is a facade of the good life. Cons were production choices and replay
                        ability. This was another solid album from Kanye West. </p>

                    <p> This album is one of Kanye West’s most praised albums, and I really liked it. My first full
                        album experience into Kanye was Graduation, and I found this much more of an experience, and was
                        made better by starting off with an iconic rap song in Dark Fantasy. This album had depth with
                        the lyrics discussing many subjects like racism, but the more drawing subjects of Kanye’s own
                        experiences with ex relationships (Blame Game) and struggles. This album had some of music's,
                        not just rap, most iconic choruses and music, like the choruses of Dark Fantasy and All of the
                        Lights, and the beat from Power. Additionally, this album was riddled with features, with some
                        of my notable ones being Kid Cudi and Raekwon on Gorgeous, Nikki Minaj and Jay Z on Monster,
                        John Legend on Blame Game, and Rihanna on All of the Lights. My only issues with this album was
                        some of the vocals from Kanye and the closing song just wasn’t that good. </p>

                    <p><strong>Initial Thoughts:</strong></p>
                    <p> This album was a fantastic listen. This was a transitional album for Taylor Swift from country
                        to pop, and it showed mainly in the instrumentals. While her voice was clear to be a pop voice
                        throughout this album, her use of classic guitar and drums still kept a country undertone. For
                        the messaging in the music, this album had surprisingly, not very simple love songs, but pretty
                        wide songs that had range in topics like how she perceives acts of love and kindness (Begin
                        Again), how fights went with a man she wanted to stay (Stay Stay Stay), post breakup desire for
                        getting back together (Almost Do), and more. Problem wise, her features I could have done
                        without, and this album still had some generic in the music. </p>

                    <p><strong>Initial Thoughts:</strong></p>
                    <p> This album was definitely an experience to say the least. The pros of this album were definitely
                        the duo of Andre 3000 and “Big Boi” Antwan Patton. This album showed how much range they had as
                        a duo in Outkast and to do a lot of experimenting. With 24 songs, this album truly had a wide
                        scope in its musical choices, from heavy electronic and funk songs like Snappin’ & Trappin’,
                        darker songs like Gasoline Dreams, gangster music in Gangsta Shit, lighter and simpler like
                        Stankonia and So Fresh, and more. The messages present throughout the album were notable, with
                        my favorites being divorce (Ms. Jackson) and to be careful while growing up in a tough area
                        (Spaghetti Junction). I also enjoyed the idea of interjecting an interlude, shown in the
                        “break!” At the end of every interlude. My biggest con was that this album had a lot and did a
                        lot, so some didn’t quite work, like the electronic music. </p>

                    <p><strong>Initial Thoughts:</strong></p>
                    <p> This album is a rap phenomenon, but it is also the history behind it that makes it that. Solely
                        album wise, this album oozed intricate lyricism, not only from Tupac himself, but his features
                        from rap legends like Nate Dogg, Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and more. The music on this album had many
                        fluctuations. This was a pro and con. While many allowed for different storytelling, I felt for
                        a 2 1/4 hour long album, it was a bit much. Some styles like heavily electronic and auto tuned
                        based songs seen in California Love were just not it for me. Also, this album is 2 HOURS AND 12
                        MINUTES long. While I understand that this was a sore of the mind and heart rage/heartache that
                        Tupac wanted to express, it was still really long winded. The history behind what this album
                        meant to the rap industry and what it signifies in the infamous East Coast vs West Coast gang
                        scene are also aspects to note greatly. The depth to this album was far reaching, and it showed.

                    <p> This album was a comedic and great listen. This was my fifth women led album. This album did a
                        lot of things right. The instrumentals of this album kept its country roots, but musical
                        production leaned into more of a Pop style, which can be similarly with Red. Additionally,
                        Shania Twain made this album! Her voice was one thing, but I enjoyed the comedic notes and
                        snickers she does throughout the entirety of the album. Hen it came to messaging, this album had
                        its overall them of love and women empowerment, but incorporated a story on how to talk to women
                        (If You Wanna Touch Her, Ask!) and a twist on the man working the 9-5 and having a hard day
                        (Honey I’m Home).</p>

                    <p> This album was such a Jazzy, upbeat experience. This album had a classic in Smooth Operator, but
                        kept that same musical style throughout a majority of the album. This album just felt like pure
                        Jazz and R&B, made better by Sade Adu’s majestic voice. This album has one of the strongest
                        beginning composition of songs I have seen. My flaws are that it slows a little bit down towards
                        the end of the second half, and though Sally was a good song, it just didn’t fit the atmosphere
                        the other songs had made. </p>

                    <p>This album started off with a noteworthy bang in Smells Like Teen Spirit, and didn’t really lose
                        steam. This album had many memorable highs, but the inspiration behind is worth discussion. Kurt
                        Cobain opened up about taking inspiration from The Beatles and Black Sabbath, and it showed.
                        With lyrics not covering sex or hard drug use as seen in many hard rock albums, and even
                        including many childlike analogies and melodie’s (Polly). However, it stayed true to its rock
                        roots with songs like Stay Way and Endless Nameless. While other rock albums have extreme highs
                        and mediocrity, this album has all equivalent songs to high highs. What drags this album down
                        for me are the lyrics. While the “innocence” the band explained they wanted to portray, the
                        message from this album was confusing. Also, some songs just didn’t seem re-listenable to me.

                    <p><strong>Initial Thoughts:</strong></p>
                    <p> This album was a fantastic listen. This album was an easy introduction for me into the genre of
                        Metal. This album had fluctuations in musical styles, but it was interesting how none of the
                        lyrics changed. This seen best on Master of Puppets, where the songs experiences a mid-song beat
                        switch but the lyrics do not change. The fluctuations worked with each other. While many
                        instruments from Rock were present, the lyrics were the real difference, with no real
                        storytelling emphasis on songs, but more direct dialogue. Lastly, Orion was a song that was a
                        standout because it encompassed all the aspects that worked on this album. Simple lyrics,
                        multiple beat switches, and fluidity between each change and tones. The flaws really only came
                        from replay ability, but also the absence of any real message behind the format of this album.

                    <p><strong>Initial Thoughts:</strong></p>
                    <p> This was my first full Alternative and Indie Rock album listen through, and I feel it is a great
                        one for anybody to start off with. This album had many instrumentals of more classic Rock, but
                        also the deeper messages of many R&B and Rap albums. The instrumentals weren’t anything special,
                        but the vocals from lead singer Morrissey were exceptional and really made this album something
                        different. Again, this album had messages, some surface and some more intricate. The ones that
                        stood out to me were loneliness and lust for love (I Know It’s Over). Additionally, Morrissey
                        opened up about how gay isolation underlies the surface message of the world attacking you from
                        many direction in The Boy With a Thorn in his Side, which I found neat. Other than the standard
                        instrumental fault, the opening was a bit weak for me compared to the rest of the album. </p>

                    <p> I had never heard of The Doors, but this was a great introduction to them. This album showed the
                        range this group had, with classic rock instrumentals used, but interestingly, influences of Pop
                        and Electronic. The End was a very dark song that was balanced with heavy instrumentals. Along
                        with that, the album also had lighter and more catchy songs like Soul Kitchen. Lastly, The
                        Crystal Ship was a stellar showing of vocals, with the lead singer having a similarity powerful
                        voice as that of Frank Sinatra. All around well done album. </p>

                    <p>(Then rating: 6/10) since this is a personal note, I will say my probably controversial take:
                        this album was alright, only alright. The themes were great, and the production on the songs I
                        listed were good, and Halftime was a banger too. </p>
                    <p><strong> Relisten thoughts: </strong></p>
                    <p> In lieu of today (7/31/2023) being the 50th day of this musical journey, I decided to do a
                        re-listen of what is said to be one of the greatest Hip Hop albums but I did not enjoy my first
                        time through on Day 1. On my second listen through, I liked this album much more. This album was
                        truly Nas’, and you could tell by his own personal stories and name calling that he does. The
                        messages of this album came from his own venture in New York, and songs like NY State of Mind
                        show the tough skin he has gained from his experience. Halftime was a great show of Nas’
                        lyricism, and One Love is a great love song that does not have a feminine focus, but instead,
                        anything but, with it being directed towards his homies, city, and family. The opening was great
                        and the ending was standard, and I enjoyed the production a lot more this time around. I still
                        say it is slightly overrated, but not as much as I first did.</p>

                    <p> This album was a great introduction into the style of gangster rap. This album has one of the
                        greatest duo of opening songs in rap with classics Straight outta Compton and F**k The Police.
                        The storytelling of this album was noteworthy, with most of all the songs seemingly preaching,
                        talking and humoring those listening. The lyrics of the songs talked about many aspects of being
                        famous discussed in todays rap genre but of more of consequences and nuisances instead of
                        flexes, like “bitches”, drugs and sex. The fluidity of the music to each other was great along
                        with the style changes with each song. The biggest con for me came from what makes this album
                        controversial. This album is gangster rap, which means many of the stories and lyrics were vivid
                        and violent towards groups like law enforcement and women, and while I was open-minded about it,
                        some moments like depictions in Dopeman and F**k The Police were a bit hard to digest. Lastly,
                        Eazy “motherfucking” E was SO good. </p>

                    <p> This album was a nice introduction to the style and production of the famous Dr. Dre. This album
                        incorporated a lot of different production styles, some came off well and some didn’t, which
                        matched with Dr. Dre and all of this star features. Thus, The production was high, and the
                        artists he featured all brought notable lyricism to the album. I enjoyed his constant work with
                        Snoop Dogg. This album was a good listen, nothing standing out but nothing to put it down for.

                    <p> This album was definitely something. This is the only album I have listened to that, during
                        initial listen, got me sad and upset. This album had no vocals, and was a run on of just
                        straight Blues and Jazz brass. This album was deep, not in the message way, but that you could
                        feel and react to every note. This album was beautiful. The biggest con is building on what I
                        stated in the beginning. This album, in my mind, is not one to re-listen to all the way through
                        more than once. It’s strong and leans a bit too heavy into the Blues part of this album. </p>

                    <p> Missy Elliott is a legend, and this album was a great look into that title. For starters, her
                        voice is incredible, with her vocals throughout the album sounding close to those of TLC, but
                        she put her extra touch on it with her comedic and snarky lyricism. Furthermore, she sounded
                        more of a singer rapper, but it never brought down her song or her performance with a more
                        lyrical rapper like Busta Rhymes. Music wise, the production on the music was standard, so it
                        was really Missy that made the music really flow and to create the vibe of this album. The
                        lyricism of Missy was also different, leaning into some double entendres or straight funny
                        lyrics. To me, replay ability to some of the songs is pretty low and mentioned early, the music
                        production was just a bit above standard, which is no disrespect to the great Timbaland, but
                        this music fit Missy and Missy only. Missy Elliott really made this album. </p>

                    <p> This album was a good alternative listen. The pros of this album were that the Pixies had songs
                        with classic rock style and instrumentals like in I Bleed and Dead, but also electronic and
                        upbeat music like Here Comes Your Man and La La La Love You, and even slight reggae influence in
                        Mr. Grieves. The fluctuation in vocals was also notable, with different members of the Pixies
                        having their time to shine. This album was good, but nothing really different stuck out to me
                        except maybe the grim nature of many of the songs of the album wasn’t overdone. </p>

                    <p> This album was a nice listen. The opening to this album was fantastic, for starters. This album
                        has two of the best songs EVER, When Doves Cry and Purple Rain. This album has extreme highs,
                        but in my opinion some lows. The different styles and rhythms used in this album are what
                        dragged this album down for me. The classic rock and soul beats (like on the former songs) were
                        outstanding, but the electronic and disco music of some of the songs (ex. Darling Nikki) were
                        just not attractive to me. But, this is Prince, and his versatility and the vibe of this album
                        bring this album back up for me. </p>

                    <p> This album was a great album to dive into the style of psychedelia. This album is a rock album,
                        but the production and musical style incorporation of psychedelia gave it an atmosphere I have
                        never really heard. Moonchild is the best example of this, with no vocals and all basic
                        electronic sounds and melodies. 21 Century Schizoid Man was lovely here since it’s better known
                        for its sample on Power by Kanye West off of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, and it also made
                        for a great opening. </p>

                    <p><strong>Initial Thoughts:</strong></p>
                    <p>This album was a nice listen on Independence Day. It is a great introduction to the energy of the
                        one and only Bruce Springsteen. The instrumentals on this album were standard, with some notable
                        ones being the bit of jazz influence on Tenth Avenue Freeze Out and the instrumentals on
                        Backstreets. The intro was standard, but did give good insight into the vocal range of Bruce
                        Springsteen. There were no huge issues with this album, but nothing that really just stuck out
                        to me, except the message of breaking modern standards and living in Born to Run.</p>

                    <p><strong>Initial Thoughts:</strong></p>
                    <p> This album was a great listen. The beginning of this album was very interesting due to the fact
                        it didn’t have any real musical importance to album but was an interlude of dialogue that gave
                        us insight into Biggie’s character. This album gave great insight into the lyrical style and
                        background of the late Notorious B.I.G.. Songs like Suicidal Thoughts, Me and My B**ch, and
                        others had fantastic storytelling, along with lyrics that were passionate. Outside of the scope
                        of the album, this was an album that was a passion project of Biggie’s, with close ones
                        explaining that he found it as a way to explain his thoughts on matter of gang violence, women,
                        sex, and more. The main down-points for me were the very vivid imagery used with women (similar
                        to the violent lyrics towards police in “Straight Outta Compton”) and many of the songs just
                        don’t make for great replays. </p>

                    <p><strong>Initial Thoughts:</strong></p>
                    <p> Yes, this album is lower rated than others, but mainly because all these albums are being
                        compared to one another. This album didn’t quite have a deeper message (that I saw) like others,
                        but I really liked the themes of moving on and wonder (as seen in In I Wonder and Homecoming).
                        but the songs are so freaking catchy and danceable, like Champion and Good Night (my favorite
                        song on the album) . Along with that, I found it notable that the musical choices of this album
                        were much more upbeat and less serious than the other albums, which I found a great style change
                        from Kanye. The simplicity of the lyrics in this album were also very distinct, even being able
                        to be enjoyed by my younger brother. </p>

                    <p> This album was a good listen. This album didn’t feel like normal pop, which is typically more
                        upbeat or positive. Instead, it leaned more into somber and depressive musical elements, but
                        still kept a soothing feel. The songs themselves ranged in messaging, with the ones that
                        resonated with me being the warning of drug use on Solo and social media consequences on
                        Facebook Story. Lastly, Frank Ocean had great vocal range on all the songs. The downsides were
                        the MANY rhythm and music switches, with some taking place within a single song. Secondly, the
                        album just didn’t have anything that struck me, but it was still an all around good album. </p>

                    <p>This was a great album, with the vocals being the biggest notable aspect. The quartet did an
                        amazing job with backup vocalization, along with their lead singer Nathan Morris doing an
                        amazing job. For the songs, they had a wide range of songs from sadder love songs to just songs
                        that made you feel good, all working pretty well together. Other than that, nothing about this
                        album really just struck me. With all the albums I have listened to, something usually just
                        clicks, but this just felt like a normal, everyday album with no real significance. Generic
                        lyrics and no deeper meanings in the songs of the albums and its themes were the biggest down
                        points for me. </p>

                    <p>This album was an interesting listen to say the least. This album tackled a very deep message of
                        suicide, along with drug addiction and abuse. This album did a great job at making you feel
                        uncomfortable with the topics, because you should, while telling about crazy ideas and impulses.
                        For an everyday listener though, this album was violent and very sexual, and I wouldn’t
                        recommend it for a genre listen, and I personally probably won’t relisten, but that doesn’t mean
                        it’s bad. It’s instrumentals and pop like influence were done well, and the song Hurt was
                        incredible to hear since it is the song that inspired Johnny Cash’s lyrics in a future famous
                        song. Its intensity that it is famous for is a bit much for me. </p>

                    websites focus was on the fundamental knowledge I gained in HTML and CSS. For HTML, I learned the
                    basic uses of sections, divs, tables, media sourcing and headers. In CSS, I learned background
                    manipulation, text formatting, text coloring, image manipulation, and other formatting options.
                    Through both of these, I created the layout of the site, but also external connections like when you
                    click the cover of the album, you'll be redirected to Wikipedia for more information, and when you
                    click the name of the album, you will be redirected to the Spotify version of the album. This is my
                    first step in front-end development and I thoroughly enjoyed this project, both on the computer and
                    in the gym. </p>
