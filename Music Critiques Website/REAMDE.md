Welcome to my first personal project! This is a website that catalogs my exploration of many of the greatest albums of all time, but it also served as a gateway into my first two self-taught languages, HTML and CSS.  
From May to July 2022, I took courses on both edX and FreeCodeCamp, where I learned basic and some intermediate knowledge of CSS and HTML. Though I do not have the certificates from either, the two months I spent learning have very much been absorbed and used in this project, which took place between July and August 2022.  
I will not go into much detail about the code or background of this project because I have already done so in the Introduction and Webpage Code Discussion sections of the website.  
I do have the site hosted! Provided here are the files I created, but the site is hosted through tiiny.host, which I will provide below.  
I hope you enjoy some of my critiques and hopefully you will see an album of your liking!  
(Please excuse my improper or ridiculous grammar. I've grown since 2022.)
