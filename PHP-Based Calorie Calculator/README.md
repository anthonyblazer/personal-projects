Welcome to my second personal project, a PHP Based Calculator! This project is a calorie calculator, which determines the needed amount of calories for maintaining current weight and functions, as well as the calories burned on a daily basis dependent on your exercise level. This calculator uses PHP and was my personal introduction to back end logic.  
In December 2023, I taught myself PHP from Codeacademy courses, and I have a Learn PHP certificate as a result of that. PHP is a popular scripting language that is mainly used for back-end logic. In this project, I used it primarily for calculating equations based on user input, but I also implemented error handling and redirection on submission.  
I do have my site hosted! I have a domain through InfinityFree and an SSL certificate that allows for HTTPS. You will see the files I made in htdocs with index.php and index2.php, but the rest are InfinityFree provided.  

Lastly, here is the link to the site (for desktop): https://blazer-health-calculator.infinityfreeapp.com  

I hope you enjoy the site (and learn something)!
